 * MuRecorder introduces MIDI input to the MuM library.
 * The class starts an independent thread that constantly
 * looks for incomming MIDI data an adds it to a pair
 * of input buffers that the rest of the class can access.
 * When user code wants to check for available data, it
 * calls GetData(), which copies available MIDI messages
 * from one of the buffers, leaving the other one free
 * to keep receiving other messages. Normally only a 
 * single object of this class needs to be instantiated 
 * within a MuM based application.

 * @brief MuRecorder Class
 *
 * @details
 *
 * INTRO:
 *
 * MuRecorder is the class responsible for MIDI input in the
 * MuM Library. The class listens to system MIDI connections
 * from devices and applications and stores received MIDI events
 * in a pair of input buffers. From there, these events can be 
 * retrieved by calling code using MuRecorder's methods.
 *
 * INITIALIZATION:
 *
 * Before being used, an MuRecorder needs to be
 * initialized. This initialization creates the necessary
 * infrastructure for the player to interact with the MIDI
 * system in the current platform. Initialization is done
 * with a call to Init(). When using CoreMIDI, Init()
 * creates a MIDI client and an input port associated with
 * it. It also verifies the available MIDI sources at the
 * moment of the call and displays a list of sources in
 * standard output (std::cout). By default, Init() selects the
 * first available source, but this choice can be overruled
 * with a subsequent call to SelectMIDISource(). ResetMIDI()
 * releases all MIDI resources created by Init(). After this call,
 * the Recorder needs to be initialized again in order be usable.
 *
 * Linux implementation of Init() performs similar tasks as its 
 * Mac (CoreMIDI) counterpart but using the equivalent RtMidi data
 * structures and methods, with an underlying ALSA infrastructure.
 *
 * Once MIDI connections are in place, Init() starts a listener thread
 * which is responsible for actually receiving MIDI events. The listener
 * pols system resources frequently looking for  MIDI messages. When 
 * a message is received, it gets copied to the current input buffer
 * and stamped with current system time with ClockStamp().
 *
 * USING RECORDERS:
 *
 * Once initialized, the recorder object will immediately start
 * listening to incomming events. Each event received from
 * the system is timestamped and stored in the currently
 * available buffer. 
 *
 * Whenever client code needs to get MIDI data it
 * calls GetData(). GetData() toggles current buffer
 * redirecting input to the other buffer, while copying data.
 * This way the listener thread doesn't have to wait to  
 * store new messages. GetData() makes a copy of the
 * available data, puts it into a MIDI buffer structure
 * (MuMIDIBuffer) and returnes it to the caller.
 * It is important to note that these buffer
 * structures depend on dynamic memory
 * allocation and that CALLING CODE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
 * DEALLOCATING this memory when no longer needed.
 *
 * Internally the MIDI buffers returned by GetData() are very simple
 * structures. They contain three fields: 'data' (which is a pointer
 * a dynamic array of MIDI message structures, 'max' which is
 * the number of elements allocated for this array and 'count'
 * which contains the number of valid elements (elements that are
 * in use). For more details about the buffer structure see MuMIDIBuffer.
 * The buffers returned by GetData() can be added into larger buffers
 * with MuRecorder::JoinMIDIBuffers() so user code can access 
 * all incomming that is continuously stored by the recorder.
 * This data can also be converted to a music material for use in MuM
 * with a call to MuMaterial::LoadMIDIBuffer();
 *
 * UNDER THE HOOD
 *
 * In order to keep working continuously and without generating wrong timestamps,
 * the listener works in a separate thread. Also it stores the data collected
 * from MIDI system in two separate, alternating buffers. Whenever GetData()
 * gets called, the listener stops writing in the current buffer and moves
 * to the other one. Meanwhile, GetData(), operating in the main thread,
 * copies data from the first buffer and returns it to calling code. The
 * two input buffers are pre-allocated when the recorder is initialized,
 * so that when getting new data, the listener never has to allocate memory, 
 * or move data around. It just copies a MIDI message structure into a new 
 * address in one of the arrays. Switching arrays is also a very cheap
 * operation (changing a pointer address) which is done by GetData(), so
 * that, as far as the listener is concerned it is just storing another
 * message to a given address.
 *
 * SAMPLE:
 *
 * There are many ways to use an MuRecorder in a MuM Application.
 * It all depends on how we need to collect input and what we want
 * to do with the it. For example, the recorder could be called
 * continuosly in a tight loop to get small blocks of data and
 * interpret them as they come. Or the app could listen for a
 * certain amount of time or until a certain event arrives, before
 * getting the data out. Whatever the strategy, using MuRecorder
 * usually involves:
 *
 * @code {.cpp}
 *
 * // instantiating a recorder object
 * MuPlayer rec;
 *
 * // initializing it...
 * rec.Init();
 *
 * // giving it some time to record events...
 * usleep(ONE_SECOND);
 *
 * // getting some data from the recorder...
 * MuMIDIBuffer buffer = GetData();
 *
 * // puting it inside a music material so it can be manipulated...
 * MuMaterial mat.LoadMIDIBuffer(buffer, MIDI_BUFFER_MODE_PURGE);
 *
 * // releasing buffer memory...
 * if(buffer.data)
 * delete [] buffer.data;
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note
 * Currently, only PLAYBACK_MODE_NORMAL is implemented.
 *
 * @warning
 *
 * MIDI BUFFERS MUST BE DEALLOCATED BY CALLING CODE to avoid
 * memory leaks.

     *
     * Init() is responsible for initializing the MIDI environment for the Recorder
     * This part of the library contains some of the most platform dependent code.
     * MuM provides implementations for two platforms which utilize a similar model
     * for capturing MIDI information: CoreMIDI on Mac OS X and RtMidi (ALSA) on Linux.
     * Code dependencies are handled here with conditional compilation macros.
     * Bellow is a brief decription of MIDI initialization for each platform. More
     * details
     *
     * CoreMIDI implementation of this method starts out by creating a
     * MIDI client  and an associated MIDI input port, so the Library
     * can receive MIDI events from the system.
     *
     * RtMidi implementation allocates similar structures, except
     * that the client already has an implict local port. So in RtMidi
     * terms, ports refer to external MIDI entities to which the client
     * connects, which, in CoreMIDI, correspond to MIDI Endpoints (sources
     * or destinations).
     *
     * After creating the input client, Init() installs a MIDI input callback
     * which is later called by the system whenever MIDI data is available
     * for retrieval. After that, the method requests the list of current MIDI
     * sources/ports to the system and displays that list to standard output.
     * This part of initialization is pretty much the same on both platforms.
     *
     * Init() always selects the first available source for
     * input, but this choice can be changed by a subsequent call to
     * SelectMIDISource(), using one of the source numbers displayed by Init().
     *
     * Normally there shouldn't be any problems with initialization, but it
     * is always safer to check the return value for this method. If Init()
     * for any reason returns 'false', it means one or more of the CoreMIDI/RtMidi
     * calls failed, in which case the MuRecorder object should not be used.
     * Init() will also fail if it cannot allocate memory for the input buffers.
